# arcsecond.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/onekiloparsec/arcsecond.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/onekiloparsec/arcsecond.js)

A javascript client for interacting with the server-side RESTful resources of arcsecond.io.

*Note*: All examples written in this README use the ES6 specification.

## Installation

It is available with bower or npm:

```
bower install arcsecond.js
npm install arcsecond.js
```

The `dist` folder contains two built versions which you can use to include either arcsecond.js or a standalone version.
Standalone version already embeds `fetch`.

Alternately, you can use a module loader like [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

```js
import restful from 'arcsecond.js';
```
